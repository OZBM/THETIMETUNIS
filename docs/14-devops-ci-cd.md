# DevOps/CI-CD & Observability

This document defines the build, test, deploy, infrastructure-as-code, and observability standards for the THETUNISTIME platform.

## 1. Objectives

*   Fast, reliable, and secure delivery of the platform.
*   Repeatable environments through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).
*   Comprehensive observability into the health and performance of the system.

## 2. Environments & Promotion

*   **Environments:** A three-tiered environment strategy will be used: Development, Staging, and Production.
*   **Promotion Flow:** A clear promotion flow will be established: `Feature Branch` → `Pull Request` → `CI Checks` → `Merge to Main` → `Auto-deploy to Staging` → `Sign-off` → `Canary to Production` → `Full Rollout`.

## 3. Branching Strategy & Versioning

*   **Git Flow:** A lightweight Git flow will be used, with feature branches created from `main`.
*   **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (SemVer) will be used for the backend API and worker services.

## 4. CI Pipelines (Core Stages)

*   **Frontend (Next.js):** The CI pipeline for the frontend will include linting, type-checking, unit tests, accessibility checks, and performance budget checks.
*   **Backend (Django):** The CI pipeline for the backend will include linting, type-checking, unit tests, security checks, and migration checks.
*   **Shared:** Shared CI stages will include SAST/DAST/SCA gates, SBOM generation, and secret scanning.

## 5. CD Pipelines (Deployment Strategy)

*   **Artifacts:** Container images will be used as deployment artifacts.
*   **Deployment:** A rolling update strategy will be used for staging, and a canary release strategy will be used for production.

## 6. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

*   **Tooling:** Terraform or Pulumi will be used for IaC.
*   **Scope:** IaC will be used to manage all infrastructure resources, including networking, compute, storage, and databases.

## 7. Database & Migrations

*   **Migration Policy:** An "expand-and-contract" migration strategy will be used to ensure zero-downtime deployments.
*   **Migration Safety:** Migrations will be tested in staging before being applied to production.

## 8. Caching & CDN Configuration as Code

*   **CDN Rules:** CDN caching rules will be managed as code.
*   **Redis Cache:** Redis cache configurations will be managed as code.

## 9. Secrets & Configuration Management

*   **Secrets:** Secrets will be stored in a centralized secret manager.
*   **Configuration:** Configuration will be managed as code, with environment-specific values injected at deploy time.

## 10. Testing Strategy (NFR-related)

*   **Performance:** Load tests and Lighthouse tests will be used to validate performance.
*   **Security:** SAST, DAST, and SCA scans will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Accessibility:** Automated and manual accessibility testing will be performed.

## 11. Observability (Logs, Metrics, Traces)

*   **Logging:** Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs will be used.
*   **Metrics:** Key business and system metrics will be collected and monitored.
*   **Tracing:** Distributed tracing will be used to trace requests across services.

## 12. Release & Change Management

*   **Release Process:** A formal release process will be established, including release notes and a rollback plan.
*   **Feature Flags:** Feature flags will be used to de-risk the release of new features.

## 13. Backups & Disaster Recovery (DR)

*   **Database:** Automated daily backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR) will be enabled.
*   **Object Storage:** Object storage will be configured for high durability and availability.
