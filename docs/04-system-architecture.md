## 4. Frontend Architecture

Next.js App Router
- Rendering strategy
  - SSR for dynamic pages requiring auth or fresh data
  - ISR for article, category, region pages with revalidation windows (60â€“300s)
- Localization
  - Route groups per locale /ar and /fr
  - Language switcher preserving path when translation exists
- RTL support
  - CSS logical properties margin inline padding inline
  - Direction aware components and mirrored icons

Performance pattern
- Critical CSS inline for above the fold content
- Route level code splitting and deferred non-critical widgets
- Image optimization with AVIF/WebP and responsive srcset
- Avoid heavy client JS for presentational UI

Security pattern
- Secure headers via Next.js middleware
- CSP with strict script sources and frame policies
- No secrets in client bundles

---

## 5. Backend Architecture

Django REST API
- Apps
  - Content
  - Categories
  - Regions
  - Media
  - Users and Roles
  - Workflow
  - AI Research and Generation
  - SEO
- Patterns
  - Class based views or DRF viewsets
  - Serializers enforce schema and validation
  - Permissions via DRF and custom decorators
- Performance
  - select_related and prefetch_related to reduce query count
  - Aggregates and materialized views for regional counts when needed
- Security
  - CSRF for forms
  - Rate limiting sensitive endpoints
  - Audit logging for workflow transitions

AI Workers
- Queues
  - Research jobs deep search
  - Generation jobs prompting pipeline
- Isolation
  - Separate process pool from web API to avoid blocking
- Resilience
  - Retries with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breakers on provider failures

W-->>API: Persist Artifacts + Sources
API-->>FE: 202 Accepted + job id
FE->>API: GET /ai/research/:id
API-->>FE: Status + Summary + Sources
```

## 6. Data Architecture

Primary store
- PostgreSQL for relational data with strict constraints

Caching
- Redis for hot reads and editorial dashboards
- Edge CDN caching for public SSR HTML and static assets

Queues
- Redis or compatible queue system for AI jobs

Media
- Object storage for media assets plus metadata persisted in DB

## 7. API Gateway and Contracts

- No external gateway required initially; LB with TLS termination
- Versioned endpoints /v1
- Authentication
  - Back office JWT or session based
  - Public endpoints read only
- Pagination limit and offset consistent across list endpoints
- ETags and cache control on GET endpoints

Note
- Detailed payload schemas will be defined in [docs/06-api-contracts.md](docs/06-api-contracts.md)

---

## 8. AI Pipeline Design

Research pipeline
- Input
  - Query, language AR FR EN, scope News Official Academic Social
- Steps
  - Source discovery via APIs and curated scrapers with ethical constraints
  - Deduplication and normalization
  - Summarization via Gemini
  - Confidence scoring and recency indicators
- Output
  - Research summary with linked sources persisted to AI artifacts

Generation pipeline
- Input
  - Selected research artifacts
  - Style preset e.g., Neutral Analytical Explainer
  - Target language AR or FR
- Steps
  - Prompt construction with structured outline Headline Intro Body Conclusion
  - Anti plagiarism guardrails firm instruction to synthesize and cite

- Cache tier Redis with clustering
- Worker pool scaling based on queue depth with back pressure limits
- Rate limits per user and per IP for public endpoints

---

## 12. SEO and i18n Architecture

- DB contention
  - Backoff, read replicas for read heavy dashboards
- CDN cache stale
  - Revalidation windows and purge on publish
- Worker crash
  - Auto restart with job retry policies

---

## 15. Security and Privacy Compliance

- Minimal PII storage for comments
- Data retention policies for logs drafts and artifacts
- Consent for cookies beyond essentials
- Regular dependency and SCA scanning

---

## 16. Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD

- IaC via Terraform or Pulumi for repeatable provisioning
- CI
  - Lint test security scan build
- CD
  - Blue green or rolling deploys
  - DB migrations with zero downtime strategy

---

## 17. Notion Documentation Upload via MCP (Plan)

Given the requirement to upload documentation to Notion through MCP:

Plan
- Implement a local MCP server notion-mcp exposing tools
  - create_page under a parent page by page id
  - upload_markdown to convert local markdown to Notion blocks
  - set_page_properties to tag language AR FR and section index
- Configure MCP settings to include NOTION_TOKEN and destination PAGE_ID
- Idempotent upsert
  - If a page with the same title exists under parent, update blocks instead of creating duplicates
- Mapping
  - Local docs paths to Notion page hierarchy defined in [docs/IA-Notion-Structure.md](docs/IA-Notion-Structure.md)

Note
- Implementation will be performed after architecture planning is approved and mode switched to code

---

## 18. Risks and Mitigations Overview

- AI hallucination and citation errors
  - Editor verification required; confidence indicators
- Performance regressions
  - Enforced budgets and monitoring
- Security misconfiguration
  - Least privilege, audits, automated checks
- SEO complexity in bilingual routing
  - Strict hreflang and canonical policies

---

## 19. Acceptance Criteria Snapshot

- End to end SSR/ISR flows operating within performance budgets
- AI pipelines enqueue and process jobs reliably with citations
- RBAC enforced across all back office operations
- Observability dashboards and alerts configured
- Documentation pages mapped and ready for MCP Notion upload
